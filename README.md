# predict fianl outcome of league of legend Project

## Project Overview
Surrendering a game for 15 minutes, when the game is not in its final stages, is a tough choice for the players. Because players are unsure whether this game still has the chance of turning this game over. This uncertainty will make players waste time in situations where they know they are losing, or to miss the chance to recover by giving up too soon. To solve this problem, this study proposes a predict model based on machine learning, which can predict the final outcome of the game 

## Objectives
1. help players to wisely allocate their time on the game and improves their overall experience.
2. help designers to reshape the surrender mechanism.
